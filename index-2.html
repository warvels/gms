                Each of us is just a human being. All together we are the noosphere, i.e., sphere of the mind!

                This is why we, the people of the planet Earth, have come together here, on this web site to share
                our
                vision of goals and objectives that we, as the mankind, have in the nearest or foreseeable future.

                To establish such goals and objectives we want, we first need to formulate the most important and
                urgent
                questions and/or problems which require our immediate attention and solution.

                Then, we are going to discuss possible answers to these questions and different approaches to
                solving
                these problems in the most effective, simple, and harmless way.

                We encourage each of you to submit questions or problems that you personally consider as the most
                vital
                for all of us now. To make your input more meaningful and less general, we would like to aggregate
                all
                you questions and problems into nine subject areas (see Submit Item page).

                Please formulate your question or problem related to one of these areas. Then, submit your
                suggestion
                using the Submit button.

                Your inputs will be published on our dashboard (View Submitted) only if they only meet simple and
                obvious Terms of Use. All of them will be analyzed, aggregated, and prepared for voting. Finally,
                together we will determine a list of the most important questions and current problems of humanity.
                We
                will then vote on submitted inputs of all of you.

                In the next step, we will use the most effective methods of crowdsourcing, crowd creation, and crowd
                wisdom to discuss each of the high-rated problems and find the most possible and the most effective
                solutions.

                Our PCs are already connected. Let us now connect our brains into the one Global Mind!

                Global Mind Share is an International Non-Profit Organization to connect our minds.
                Together we are building a global cognitive network that aggregates the problems faced by and
                solutions
                suggested by mankind. This is a tool to maximize the collective thought power of our planet to
                improve
                future prosperity and happiness of all people.
                All the world's people want a better future for themselves, their children, their grandchildren, and
                all
                future generations. Global Mind Share will collect the problems that are most important to the
                world,
                the problems that must be solved if mankind is going to survive and endure. Then, we will solve them
                together. Once solutions are suggested and rated, the most popular solutions are passed on to
                international decision-making entities.
