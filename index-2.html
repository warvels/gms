                <h3>Our Vision</h3>

                <p> Each of us is just a human being. All together we are the noosphere, i.e., sphere of the mind!
                </p>

                <p> This is why we, the people of the planet Earth, have come together here, on this web site to share
                    our
                    vision of goals and objectives that we, as the mankind, have in the nearest or foreseeable future.
                </p>

                <p> To establish such goals and objectives we want, we first need to formulate the most important and
                    urgent questions and/or problems which require our immediate attention and solution.
                </p>

                <p> Then, we are going to discuss possible answers to these questions and different approaches to
                    solving these problems in the most effective, simple, and harmless way.
                </p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="row-fluid">
            <p> We encourage each of you to submit questions or problems that you personally consider as the most vital
                for
                all of us now. To make your input more meaningful and less general, we would like to aggregate
                all you questions and problems into nine subject areas (see Submit Item page).
            </p>

            <p> Please formulate your question or problem related to one of these areas. Then, submit your
                suggestion using the Submit button. </p>

            <p> Your inputs will be published on our dashboard (View Submitted) only if they only meet simple and
                obvious Terms of Use. All of them will be analyzed, aggregated, and prepared for voting. Finally,
                together we will determine a list of the most important questions and current problems of humanity.
                We
                will then vote on submitted inputs of all of you.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next step, we will use the most effective methods of crowdsourcing, crowd creation, and crowd
                wisdom to discuss each of the high-rated problems and find the most possible and the most effective
                solutions.
            </p>

            <p>Global Mind Share is an International Non-Profit Organization to connect our minds.
            </p>

            <p>Together we are building a global cognitive network that aggregates the problems faced by and
                solutions
                suggested by mankind. This is a tool to maximize the collective thought power of our planet to

                future prosperity and happiness of all people.
            </p>

            <p>All the world's people want a better future for themselves, their children, their grandchildren, and
                all future generations. Global Mind Share will collect the problems that are most important to the
                world, the problems that must be solved if mankind is going to survive and endure. Then, we will solve
                them
                together. Once solutions are suggested and rated, the most popular solutions are passed on to
                international decision-making entities.

            <h3>Our Founders</h3>
            <h4>George E. Mikhailovsky (Mi khile hof sky)</h4>

            <p>Dear friends,<br>Let me introduce myself. I am George Mikhailovsky, President and founder of Global Mind
                Share. I was born in Moscow, Russia and graduated from Moscow State University as a biophysicist. After
                post-graduate education, I defended a thesis on chemical carcinogenesis and gained a Candidate of
                Science degree. Then my interests changed to system ecology and further to bio oceanography. I
                participated in more than twenty arctic biological expeditions and scientific cruises of Russian Academy
                of Science into all the five oceans, and was in charge of some of them. At the same time, I elaborated
                on multi-dimensional statistical models of plankton communities and wrote computer programs using
                FORTRAN and later C to implement them. In 1983, I became a Doctor of Science defending a thesis on
                system ecology.
            </p>

            <p>In 1995, after winning a Green Card in a lottery, my wife and I moved to the United States. After this, I
                improved my programming skills learning Visual Basic and then PowerBuilder, and started a new career as
                a programmer and then systems analyst. In 1999 I met Gary Sorrell, the most outstanding person in my
                life. At that time Gary had 30 years experience as a corporate founder, CEO, CFO, and COO for several
                companies. He has more recently been the Treasurer and Auditor for a non-profit organization. Gary
                taught me a lot about life, its values and meanings.
            </p>

            <p>About a year ago I came up with an idea for Global Mind Share, a web site where all habitants of planet
                Earth could formulate the most principal problems of mankind and discuss how to solve them. Gary was the
                first friend outside my family with whom I shared this idea and who immediately supported me to develop
                such a site. We decided to found an international non-profit organization called Global Mind Share and
                to start this web site to provide everybody a place to submit the problems, to discuss them, to choose
                the most crucial of them, and to look together for their solutions.
            </p>

            <p>Today we welcome each of you in your new home. It will be all of you, not us, who will make it cozy,
                warm, and attractive. We will keep the web site running, but it is you who will submit problems, write
                comments, and elaborate the best methods of collective thinking, crowd-sourcing, and crowd wisdom. Any
                of you who are ready to volunteer in running and developing this project, please go to the About Us page
                and send a message to us. If you want to help us, but don�t have time to volunteer, you could donate any
                amount of money affordable for you at the Donations page. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
            </p>

            <p>In the middle of the last century, French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Russian geochemist
                Vladimir Vernadsky elaborated on a concept of noosphere, the sphere of human thought. They believed that
                a time would come when creative people all over the world would combine their intellectual forces to
                ignite a spark of the global mind. Hasn�t this time come now with global spreading of the Internet and
                social media? If you agree with this, then you are in the right place.
            </p>

            <p>Let�s spin a web of noosphere together�

            <h4>Gary Sorrell</h4>

            <p>My name is Gary Sorrell, Chairman of Global Mind Share, and currently serving as Secretary and Treasurer
                for the organization. When George first shared this concept with me, it was the most exciting idea I had
                heard of in a long time and, of course, I encouraged George to pursue the concept and create a web site
                to do what he wanted to do to improve our world. Not only was I excited about this, but other family
                members found it interesting and some of them are now involved in the web site development process. With
                George�s background and dedication to every project in which he has ever been involved, I knew he would
                create something that would be beneficial for all mankind, and he has achieved that already. Under his
                direction, the web site is now operational and will grow over time with the help of all of you who visit
                the site and offer your suggestions and submit problems that you believe are most important to ensuring
                our planet will continue to be a great place in which to live and raise our children. I hope you will
                join us as we continue to use and improve the Global Mind Share web site.
            </p>

            <p>As George has said, let�s spin a web of noosphere together�
